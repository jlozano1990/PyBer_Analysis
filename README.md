# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the ride sharing data of our ride service, based on the type of city where the service is being used. Analyzing the data available to us, we can see different patterns when it comes to average fares in different city types, amount of drivers available, and finally weekly reports for fares collected. With this analysis, we will be able to make important business decisions such as using different forms of marketing to attract riders or finding new ways to recruit more drivers in cities where they're needed. The final piece of analysis shows us the total fare collected by city type over a period of 4 months, which we can use to analyze profitability for our service in different city types.
## Results
In general, our analysis shows that our ride service gets used more often in urban cities, that there are more drivers servicing urban cities, and that fares tend to be the lowest in urban cities.

When we display the amount of rides based on city type in a box and whisker plot, we can see that urban cities tend to have the most rides.

We can also see that rural cities tend to have the highest fares.

Looking at the amount of drivers based on city type, we can see that most drivers work in urban cities.

Looking at our results in a pie chart shows us all the same results in a format that is a lot faster to look at. From the results, we can see that urban areas have the majority of fares collected, rides completed, and drivers working with the service.

Our final chart involved taking all of our data and providing a better look at the results over a specific time period. Throughout this time period, we can see the results match up with the previous charts provided. Urban cities have the highest number of fares collected while Rural cities have the least. If we look more closely at the results, we can see fluctations in fares between February and April.

## Business Recommendations
- We should look to hire more drivers in suburban and rural areas. This would bring the ride price down in those areas, which would most likely lead to more people using the service and more frequently.
- We should look at the Fare by city results over a longer period of time to predict times of the year when demand for rides goes down. By doing this, we could prepare and offer special promotions or discounts for riders to use the service during low demand times, that way we won't see as many drops in usage rate and fares collected.
- Urban areas are the areas where we make the most money by far. We could look at the possibility of increasing pricing by a small amount in urban areas, such that it doesn't bother consumers, but it does create more profit for the company.
