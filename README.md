# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the ride sharing data of our ride service, based on the type of city where the service is being used. Analyzing the data available to us, we can see different patterns when it comes to average fares in different city types, amount of drivers available, and finally weekly reports for fares collected. With this analysis, we will be able to make important business decisions such as using different forms of marketing to attract riders or finding new ways to recruit more drivers in cities where they're needed. The final piece of analysis shows us the total fare collected by city type over a period of 4 monhts, which we can use to analyze profitability for our service in different city types.
## Results
In general, our analysis shows that our ride service gets used more often in urban cities.
